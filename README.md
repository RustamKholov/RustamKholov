# 📘 About Me – Rustam Kholov

Hi! I'm **Rustam**, a self-driven developer on a mission to learn software development through structured experimentation and practical game design.

### 🎓 Study Journey
In just **2 months**, I built a fully structured Snake game from scratch in C#, with:
- Event-driven architecture  
- Manual dependency injection  
- Dynamic menu and leaderboard logic  

Now, I'm exploring **WinForms UI** with a custom-built **Minesweeper game**, designed for scalability, UX polish, and clean separation of logic and view.

### 🧠 What Drives Me
- I **don’t want shortcuts** — I want to understand.  
- I build real things, not tutorials.  
- I ask the *right questions*, and then dig deeper.

---

### 🚀 Current Focus
- WinForms (UI layout, control patterns, grid logic)  
- Clean architecture (logic–UI separation)  
- SQLite for local persistence  
- Responsiveness and user experience in game interfaces

---

### 📍 Goals Ahead
- Build a modern web version (Blazor or Unity)  
- Explore testable UI architecture (MVP/MVVM)  
- Learn how to publish and distribute real apps
