# 👋 Rustam Kholov

I'm a C# developer focused on building systems that are well-structured, interactive, and teach me something new every time.

In just a couple of months, I’ve built console-based and GUI-driven games (like Snake and Minesweeper) using event-driven architecture, manual DI, and scalable UI logic.
Now I’m transitioning toward projects that integrate databases, state management, and eventually web or Unity-based interfaces.

I design with intent, debug with curiosity, and build to understand.
> “Build what you can’t yet understand — then learn why it worked.”


### 📍 Goals Ahead
- Build a modern web apps (Blazor or Unity)  
- Explore testable UI architecture (MVP/MVVM)  
- Learn how to publish and distribute real apps
