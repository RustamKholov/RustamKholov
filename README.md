# 👋 Rustam Kholov

I'm a C# developer focused on building systems that are well-structured, interactive, and teach me something new every time.

What started with console-based and GUI-driven games (like Snake and Minesweeper) has evolved into full-stack web applications. My recent milestone project, [Anekdotify](https://github.com/RustamKholov/Anekdotify), is a comprehensive joke sharing platform built with .NET 8, Blazor Server, PostgreSQL, and Docker - demonstrating clean architecture, real-time interactions, user authentication, and containerized deployment.

I design with intent, debug with curiosity, and build to understand.

### 📍 Goals Ahead
- Build enterprise-grade applications with scalable architecture
- Explore microservices and cloud deployment (Azure/AWS)
- Master advanced patterns like CQRS and Event Sourcing
